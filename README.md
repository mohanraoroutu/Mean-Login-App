# Mean-Login-App
We’re going to look at managing user authentication in the MEAN stack. We’ll use the most common MEAN architecture of having an Angular single-page app using a REST API built with Node, Express and MongoDB.  When thinking about user authentication, we need to tackle the following things:      * let a user register     * save their data, but never directly store their password     * let a returning user log in     * keep a logged in user’s session alive between page visits     * have some pages that can only been seen by logged in users     * change output to the screen depending on logged in status (e.g. a “login” button or a “my profile” button).
